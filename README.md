# Polymarket-api-fetcher
Polymarket Local Orderflow Dashboard is an open‑source Python + FastAPI and React/Vite toolkit that fetches real‑time trades from the public Polymarket data API, computes whale activity, top traders, market statistics, and orderflow metrics, and exposes them via a REST + WebSocket backend for a modern, Tailwind‑styled frontend dashboard.
